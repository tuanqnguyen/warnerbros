Notes

This exercise uses plain vanilla PHP to write the API using MAMP on localhost

Access index.php to see a list of sample API call URLs that you can click on to see the API working

The crime data used is from:
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present

And was downloaded as a CSV file here and placed here:
/database/Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present.csv

The zipped SQL file to import the data into a MySQL database is located here:
/database/reported_crimes.zip

Unzip the file first and then import into MySQL.

An import script was written to format the data and then insert it into a table

A database connection is established using MySQLi and uses prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

A list of API call URLs and the queries that they run against the database are found at:
